Game Title:

Hactoberfest Hunt

Game Description:
	
Game consists of fields similar to a chessboard with a Hacktoberfest word hidden.
Each time the user selects a tile it will flip and show the content inside it.
The tile will either display a cross or a letter present in the Hacktoberfest word. There
will be a player and a opponet (either bot or friend). The person to strike all the words
first will win the prize (ie. prize will be displayed as Hactoberfest t-shirt).

Rules:

1. Only one tile can be selected at a time.
2. The person who selects the tile with correct letters of the word will get another turn.
3. The person who selects all the letters of Hacktoberfest will win the game.

Special Moves:

1. First would allow the player an extra turn eventhough the guess was wrong.
2. Second would allow to user to flip the position of tiles before the other user can perform the moves.
3. Provide hint of the opponents tile positions.
4. Each move can be used only once.
